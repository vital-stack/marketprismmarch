> Forensic narrative intelligence platform for institutional-grade equity market analysis.

Market Prism is a patent-pending (US 63/971,470 & 63/971,478) financial analysis platform that applies forensic narrative intelligence to equity markets. It analyzes the gap between market stories and fundamental reality using seven proprietary analytical layers.

## What Market Prism Provides

- **Narrative Verdicts**: Every covered ticker receives one of three classifications — Narrative Trap, Structurally Supported, or Monitoring — based on forensic signal analysis.
- **Fair Value Deviation (FVD)**: Quantifies how far a stock's price has diverged from its estimated fair value, measured as a percentage.
- **Narrative Energy**: Measures the remaining momentum in a market story (0–100%), indicating whether the thesis is gaining or losing traction.
- **Coordination Detection**: Identifies when multiple sources converge on the same narrative within a narrow window, signaling potential fragility.
- **Decay Physics**: Models narrative half-life — how quickly market stories lose conviction — using radioactive decay mathematics.
- **Trade Signals**: Directional bias (LONG/SHORT) with confidence scores and suggested holding periods.

## Data Freshness

Analysis is updated every trading day before the US market open (pre-9:30 AM ET). Blog articles are published Monday–Friday at 7:00 AM ET.
